## About Me

I'm on a thrilling rollercoaster-like journey to become a web developer one day.

While learning to catch as much of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS in my Pok√© Balls.

Positively thrilled and naive about it, like a 10-year-old kid from Pallet Town.


	const me = {
	  name: 'Tom',
	  age: 'Old enough to know that Pikachu evolves into Raichu, young enough to believe in coding magic.',
	  skills: ['JavaScript', 'HTML', 'CSS'],
	  currentGoal: 'My next gym badges: Node and React! üí™üèÜ',
	};
